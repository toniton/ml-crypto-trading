# Introduction

## Motivation

The intent of developing yet-another-trading-bot is to create a simple trading bot that combines engineering
expertise with financial skills within a clean, modular architecture. To enhance easy collaboration — allowing
developers and traders to integrate, experiment, and extend trading strategies with minimal complexity.

## Core Features (Currently Supported)

### Multi-Asset Support

Trade and manage multiple assets seamlessly across supported exchanges.

### Consensus Strategy

Multi-strategy decision engine powered by a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) voting mechanism.

### Intelligent Trading Scheduler

Trading scheduler gives you control over the frequency each asset trades: every second to every minute, hour, or day.

### Audit Log Replay

Audit logs can be replayed through the backtesting system.

### Trading mode

- Spot trading

### Supported Exchanges

- [Crypto.com Exchange](https://crypto.com/exchange)

### Simulated Trading

You can run the bot in simulated mode, where order placement is intercepted and executed in-memory without hitting the
real exchange.
